Week (23 to 1 of March)

Week (9 to 15 of March)

- Got back the same error that prevents me from building the app. I could not find the solution so I made a post for help in a Flutter's forum. (09-03-2025)

- Create an organization for the project in Supabase linked with my git (12-03-2025)
- Followed the guide (12-03-2025)
- Continued to follow the guide (15-03-2025)

Week (16 to 22 of March)

- Continued to follow the guide, got an error, figured out what the problem was: To log into the account page, we send an email to our own email address, but to do that, we need to open the link in the email through LDPlayer to make it work (16-03-2025)
- Finished the guide. Next step: Create the phone contact page (16-03-2025)

- Created the Supabase project online and settled it in the flutter project (23-03-2025)
- Created the pages for the authenticator, reset password and signup page. Cannot test them yet as I need to create the tables in supabase (23-03-2025)
- Created the table "users". Note that we don't need to stack the passwords in a table. Supabase auth already manage the passwords in a secure way. (25-03-2025)
- Created the table "userRoles" and added a relation between those two tables. (25-03-2025)

Week (30 to 5 of April)

- Installed PostgreSQL (A free software used for backups, this will probably save us money instead of subscribing to supabase pro for 25$ a month for backups.) (30-03-2025)
- After 2 hours of trying to make it works, I never found a way to use PostGreSQL to create backup of the supabase SQL (30-03-2025)
Note: I will work on that another time. I want to make the pages work along with the data in Supabase.
- Fixed the email validators for the signup page
- Worked on the create account page. struggled to make the data getting inserted into supabase, but did not succeeded yet. (02-04-2025)

Week (6 to 12 of April)

- Worked on the signup page's problem: With a query to the users table, check for if the email exists. I could not get the info from the table users from supabase
	* I unchecked the RLS for the table users. This is not a good practice but I will need to have cloud server later to be able to do queries inside the flutter app
	  without the need to have permissions to do queries (06-04-2025)

Week (13 to 19 of April)

- Settled the URL Configuration and the Redirect URL (13-04-2025)
- Downloaded Winmerge to compare any changes between 2 texts (13-04-2025)
- Tried to make the password reset work, but was not able to fix it yet (13-04-2025)
- Implemented supabase_auth_ui that is supposed to work better for the login/create/reset password page (16-04-2025)
- Only added the logic to use the supabase_auth_ui on password_reset page (16-04-2025)
- Got an error thats preventing the app to run, after many trials, I needed to remove the plugin uni_links and use app_links instead. uni_links does not seem to be much compatible with the latest version of flutter (16-04-2025)

! Note: Next week, make sure that the logic to redirect from the email link directly to the app is working

Week (20 to 26 of April)

- Overworked to fix the problem
- A person online fixed the problem

Week (27 to 3 of May)

-- Pause, worked too much the weeks earlier

Week (4 to 10 of May)

- Cleaned up supabase data (04-05-2025)
- Took a look at the changes made by the person online (04-05-2025)
- The password recovery emails are being sent to the spams, I'm trying to find a way to fix this. (04-05-2025)
- Installed docker Desktop and supabase local in visual studio (04-05-2025)
- Re-cloned the git for supabase to fix some errors (04-05-2025)
- Finally made Docker Desktop run Supabase container (04-05-2025)
Note: Docker is good to use especially for development. (04-05-2025)
	* Supabase provides several services (PostgreSQL Auth, Storage, etc.)
	* Docker compose sets all of these up locally with one command, giving the same backend we'd 
	  get in production 
- Note for next week to try to fix the mails being sent to the spam folder:
	* Take a look at chatgpt's last recommendations:
		~ SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are correctly set for your domain.
		~ The "from" address matches the domain you have configured in your DNS.
 		~ Your email content doesn't contain common spam trigger words or formatting issues.
		~ You're not sending emails too frequently from a new account.
		~ Consider using a dedicated IP for sending (if available).

Vérifier avec Guillaume:
- Si un abonnement est dû avant la date de l'événement, comment on va gérer la priorité de l'événement? 
Est-ce qu'on laisse la priorité telle quelle, et qu'on se base quand même sur la date la plus 
récente de l'abonnement, même si échu?

Réponse: Quand un abonnement est échu, la priorité de l'événement descend, ce qui fait que ça va automatiquement faire descendre l'événement dans la liste
